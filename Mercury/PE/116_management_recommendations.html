                           <li><strong>A high-risk PE</strong> is defined as a systolic blood pressure <strong>(SBP)
                                 &lt;90 mmHg or a SBP drop by &ge;40 mmHg for &gt;15 minutes</strong>, if not caused by

                        common practice<strong> to give thrombolysis immediately </strong>without waiting for results of
                        investigations (based on discussion between senior clinicians).</li>
                     <li><strong>Give intravenous fluids if SBP &lt;90 mmHg or there are other signs of shock.

                                          <li>One prospective study of 13 patients with high-risk haemodynamically
                                             unstable PE suggested that fluid loading (an infusion of 500 mL of dextran
                                             40 over 20 minutes) can improve hemodynamic status. It was shown to
                                             increase right ventricular preload which was associated with an increase in
                                             cardiac index without reducing the right ventricular ejection fraction.

                                    <li>Some studies have shown that anticoagulation may be of no clinical benefit. One meta-analysis examined 750 patients with SSPE, of whom 81% were treated with anticoagulation. Over 90 days there was no difference in mortality or recurrence of PE between those who did and did not receive anticoagulation but 8% of treated patients had an episode of bleeding. [JEFF] In an observational study, 15% (82 patients) of PEs found on CTPA were SSPEs. Around half of these patients were anticoagulated, and 2 developed life-threatening bleeding. No patient had an identified recurrent PE, whether or not they were anticoagulated. [GOY] The risk of recurrence of VTE in patients with SSPE without a concurrent DVT has been found to be insignificant in retrospective studies. [SOJ] [HULL]</li>
                                    <li>On the other hand, a retrospective study of over 3000 patients showed that the rate of recurrence of PE during anticoagulant therapy was the same in patients with SSPE and those with larger PE (ie. segmental or lobar). It also showed that VTE recurrence was higher with SSPE than in those in whom PE was excluded. [KLOK]</li>

Maternal thrombocytopenia was reported in 10 cases (1.6%), two being serious but unrelated to enoxaparin. Eight pregnancies ended in stillbirth (1.1%). Among the 693 live births, 17 major congenital abnormalities (2.5%) and 10 serious neonatal haemorrhages (1.4%) were reported. None of the fetal or neonatal adverse events was related to enoxaparin. Eight venous thromboembolic events (1.3%) were reported.The incidence of adverse events reported could be explained by the high risk profile of the study population.

                        <h2>Thrombolysis</h2>
                        <p>Ideally, PE should be confirmed by computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) prior to thrombolysis. [BARCO] In practice, <strong>thrombolysis is typically started on clinical grounds if a high-risk PE is highly suspected and there is evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Administer thrombolysis (unless contraindicated) to any patient with SBP &lt;90 mmHg or who has other signs of shock. </strong></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Systemic thrombolysis is associated with <strong>lower all-cause mortality</strong> in these patients when compared with UFH alone. [ESC] [CARDIO]</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Give thrombolysis as soon as possible and certainly within 48 hours of symptom onset to ensure optimum benefit.</strong> [ESC]</p>
                        <p><strong>Select an accelerated regimen administered over 2 hours.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>These regimens are preferred to prolonged infusions over 12-24 hours. The European Society of Cardiology guideline lists <strong>alteplase, streptokinase, and urokinase</strong> as approved thrombolytics for acute PE. [ESC] Alteplase and higher-dose streptokinase are administered over 2 hours; whereas, lower-dose streptokinase and urokinase are administered over 12 to 24 hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Give a vasopressor such as adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine), or an inotrope such as dobutamine if SBP remains &lt;90 mmHg after thrombolysis</strong>[ESC]</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>In haemodynamically unstable patients, use of a vasopressor or an inotrope is often needed in parallel with reperfusion. [ESC]</li>

                                 <li>Among the minority of patients with high-risk PE who did not respond to thrombolysis, rescue surgical embolectomy led to lower mortality rates and fewer recurrent PEs when compared with repeat thrombolysis.</li>

                                 <li>An overview of 308 PE patients from 5 clinical trials who underwent thrombolysis for PE showed an inverse relation between duration of symptoms and improvement on post-treatment lung scan reperfusion scores. For each additional day of symptoms before thrombolysis, there was a decrease of 0.8% in lung tissue reperfusion. Similarly, on angiography, less clot lysis was observed immediately after thrombolysis in the group with the longest duration of symptoms compared with those with the shortest symptom duration.</li>
                                 <li>However the authors concluded that thrombolysis may still have some benefit in patients who have had symptoms for 6 to 14 days. [AM]</li>

                                 <li>It is common practice to seek advice from a haematologist in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation.</li>
                                 <li>Many of these patients - even those with apparent absolute contraindications - may still be able to have a different or altered dose of anticoagulation with an acceptable risk-benefit balance and this is usually preferred to a venous filter.</li>

                                          <p><strong>The use of venous filters is controversial and there is limited evidence to support recommendations about their use in clinical practice</strong>. <strong>For use in acute PE the evidence shows varied outcomes. </strong></p>
                                          <ul>
                                          <li>There have only been two RCTs performed in Europe.</li>
                                          <li>The first, PREPIC (Pr&eacute;vention du Risque d'Embolie Pulmonaire par Interruption Cave Study Group), randomized 400 patients who suffered acute VTE to anticoagulation alone or anticoagulation and a permanent inferior vena cava filter (IVCF). Follow up at 8 years showed that while IVC filters reduced the risk of recurrent PE, they did not prevent death, and more DVTs occurred in patients who received these devices.</li>
                                          <li>The second study, PREPIC 2, randomised 399 patients with PE associated with DVT to anticoagulation alone or anticoagulation plus a retrievable IVCF. All the patients had at least one "high-risk" feature (age &gt;75 years old, active cancer, chronic cardiac or respiratory insufficiency, ischemic stroke with leg paralysis within 6 months, either iliocaval or bilateral DVT, or a sign of right ventricular strain or myocardial injury). Again, use of venous filter did not show any mortality benefit nor did they result in fewer symptomatic PEs during the first 3 months of follow-up.</li>
                                          <li>On the other hand observational studies from the US, analyzing almost 298,000 filter implantations, &nbsp;suggest that insertion of a venous filter might reduce PE-related mortality rates in the acute phase, with benefit possibly coming at the cost of an increased risk of recurrence of VTE.
